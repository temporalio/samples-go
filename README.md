  the [Quick install guide](https://docs.temporal.io/application-development/foundations#run-a-development-cluster)), then clone this repository

The [helloworld](./helloworld) sample is a good place to start.

## Samples directory

Each sample demonstrates one feature of the SDK, together with tests.

- [**Basic hello world**](./helloworld): Simple example of a Workflow
  Definition and an Activity Definition.

- [**Basic mTLS hello world**](./helloworldmtls): Simple example of a
  Workflow Definition and an Activity Definition using mTLS like Temporal Cloud.

### API demonstrations

- **Async activity completion**: Example of
  an [Expense reporting](./expense) Workflow that communicates with a
  server API. Additional
  documentation: [How to complete an Activity Execution asynchronously in Go](https://docs.temporal.io/application-development/foundations/#develop-activities)

- [**Retry Activity Execution**](./retryactivity): This samples
  executes an unreliable Activity. The Activity is executed with a custom Retry Policy. If the Activity Execution fails,
  the Server will schedule a retry based on the Retry Policy. This Activity also includes a Heartbeat, which enables it
  to resume from the Activity Execution's last reported progress when it retries.

- [**Child Workflow**](./child-workflow): Demonstrates how to use
  execute a Child Workflow from a Parent Workflow Execution. A Child Workflow Execution only returns to the Parent
  Workflow Execution after completing its last Run.

- [**Child Workflow with ContinueAsNew**](./child-workflow-continue-as-new): Demonstrates
  that the call to Continue-As-New, by a Child Workflow Execution, is *not visible to the a parent*. The Parent Workflow
  Execution receives a notification only when a Child Workflow Execution completes, fails or times out. This is a useful
  feature when there is a need to **process a large set of data**. The child can iterate over the data set calling
  Continue-As-New periodically without polluting the parents' history.

- [**Cancellation**](./cancellation): Demonstrates how to cancel a
  Workflow Execution by calling `CancelWorkflow`, an how to defer an Activity Execution that "cleans up" after the
  Workflow Execution has been cancelled.

- **Coroutines**: Do not use native `go` routines in Workflows. Instead use Temporal coroutines (`workflow.Go()`) to
  maintain a [deterministic](https://docs.temporal.io/application-development/foundations/#develop-workflows) Workflow. Can be
  seen in the [Goroutine](./goroutine)
  , [DSL](./dsl)
  , [Recovery](./recovery)
  , [PSO](./pso) Workflow examples.

- [**Cron Workflow**](./cron): Demonstrates a recurring Workflow
  Execution that occurs according to a cron schedule. This samples showcases the `HasLastCompletionResult`
  and `GetLastCompletionResult` APIs which are used to pass information between executions. Additional
  documentation: [What is a Temporal Cron Job?](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/content/what-is-a-temporal-cron-job).

- [**Schedule Workflow**](./schedule): Demonstrates a recurring Workflow
  Execution that occurs according to a schedule.
  documentation: [Schedule](https://docs.temporal.io/workflows#schedule).

- [**Encryption**](./encryption): How to use encryption for
  Workflow/Activity data with the DataConverter API. Also includes an example of stacking encoders (in this case
  encryption and compression)

- [**Codec Server**](./codec-server): Demonstrates using a codec
  server to decode payloads for display in tctl and Temporal Web. This setup can be used for any kind of codec, common
  examples are compression or encryption.

- [**Query Example**](./query): Demonstrates how to Query the state
  of a single Workflow Execution using the `QueryWorkflow` and `SetQueryHandler` APIs. Additional
  documentation: [How to Query a Workflow Execution in Go](https://docs.temporal.io/application-development/features/#queries).

- **Selectors**: Do not use the native Go `select` statement. Instead
  use [Go SDK Selectors](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/go/selectors) (`selector.Select(ctx)`) to maintain
  a [deterministic](https://docs.temporal.io/application-development/foundations/#develop-workflows) Workflow. Can be seen in
  the [Pick First](./pickfirst)
  , [Mutex](./mutex)
  , [DSL](./dsl),
  and [Timer](./timer) examples.

- **Sessions**: Demonstrates how to bind a set of Activity Executions to a specific Worker after the first Activity
  executes. This feature is showcased in
  the [File Processing example](./fileprocessing). Addition
  documentation: [How to use Sessions in Go](https://docs.temporal.io/tasks/#sessions).

- **Signals**: Can be seen in the [Recovery](./recovery)
  and [Mutex](./mutex) examples. Additional
  documentation: [eCommerce application tutorial](https://learn.temporal.io/tutorials/go/ecommerce/)
  , [How to send and handle Signals in Go](https://docs.temporal.io/application-development/features/#signals)
  .

- [**Memo**](./memo): Demonstrates how to use Memo that can be used
  to store any kind of data.

- [**Search Attributes**](./searchattributes): Demonstrates how to
  use custom Search Attributes that can be used to find Workflow Executions using predicates (must use
  with [Elasticsearch](https://docs.temporal.io/cluster-deployment-guide/#elasticsearch)).

- [**Timer Futures**](./timer): The sample starts a long running
  order processing operation and starts a Timer (`workflow.NewTimer()`). If the processing time is too long, a
  notification email is "sent" to the user regarding the delay (the execution does not cancel). If the operation
  finishes before the Timer fires, then the Timer is cancelled.

- [**Tracing and Context Propagation**](./ctxpropagation):
  Demonstrates the client initialization with a context propagator, which propagates specific information in
  the `context.Context` object across the Workflow Execution. The `context.Context` object is populated with information
  prior to calling `StartWorkflow`. This example demonstrates that the information is available in the Workflow
  Execution and Activity Executions. Additional
  documentation: [How to use tracing in Go](https://docs.temporal.io/go/tracing).

- [**Updatable Timer**](./updatabletimer): Demonstrates timer
  cancellation and use of a Selector to wait on a Future and a Channel simultaneously.

- [**Greetings**](./greetings): Demonstrates how to pass dependencies
  to activities defined as struct methods.

- [**Greetings Local**](./greetingslocal): Demonstrates how to pass
  dependencies to local activities defined as struct methods.

- [**Interceptors**](./interceptor): Demonstrates how to use
  interceptors to intercept calls, in this case for adding context to the logger.

- [**Update**](./update): Demonstrates how to create a workflow that reacts
  to workflow update requests.

### Dynamic Workflow logic examples

These samples demonstrate some common control flow patterns using Temporal's Go SDK API.

- [**Dynamic Execution**](./dynamic): Demonstrates how to execute
  Workflows and Activities using a name rather than a strongly typed function.

- [**Branching Activities**](./branch): Executes multiple Activities
  in parallel. The number of branches is controlled by a parameter that is passed in at the start of the Workflow
  Execution.

- [**Exclusive Choice**](./choice-exclusive): Demonstrates how to
  execute Activities based on a dynamic input.

- [**Multi-Choice**](./choice-multi): Demonstrates how to execute
  multiple Activities in parallel based on a dynamic input.

- [**Mutex Workflow**](./mutex): Demonstrates the ability to
  lock/unlock a particular resource within a particular Temporal Namespace. In this examples the other Workflow
  Executions within the same Namespace wait until a locked resource is unlocked. This shows how to avoid race conditions
  or parallel mutually exclusive operations on the same resource.

- [**Goroutine Workflow**](./goroutine): This sample executes
  multiple sequences of activities in parallel using the `workflow.Go()` API.

- [**Pick First**](./pickfirst): This sample executes Activities in
  parallel branches, picks the result of the branch that completes first, and then cancels other Activities that have
  not finished.

- [**Split/Merge Future**](./splitmerge-future): Demonstrates how to
  use futures to await for completion of multiple activities invoked in parallel. This samples to processes chunks of a
  large work item in parallel, and then merges the intermediate results to generate the final result.

- [**Split/Merge Selector**](./splitmerge-selector): Demonstrates how
  to use Selector to process activity results as soon as they become available. This samples to processes chunks of a
  large work item in parallel, and then merges the intermediate results to generate the final result.

- [**Synchronous Proxy Workflow pattern**](./synchronous-proxy): This
  sample demonstrates a synchronous interaction with a "main" Workflow Execution from a "proxy" Workflow Execution. The
  proxy Workflow Execution sends a Signal to the "main" Workflow Execution, then blocks, waiting for a Signal in
  response.

- [**Saga pattern**](./saga): This sample demonstrates how to implement
  a saga pattern using golang defer feature.

- [**Await for signal processing**](./await-signals): Demonstrates how
  to process out of order signals processing using `Await` and `AwaitWithTimeout`.

- [**Worker-specific Task Queues**](./worker-specific-task-queues): Use a unique task queue per Worker to have certain Activities only run on that specific Worker. For instance for a file processing Workflow, where one Activity downloads a file and subsequent Activities need to operate on that file. (If multiple Workers were on the same queue, subsequent Activities may get run on different machines that don't have the downloaded file.)

### Scenario based examples

- [**DSL Workflow**](./dsl): Demonstrates how to implement a
  DSL-based Workflow. This sample contains 2 yaml files that each define a custom "workflow" which instructs the
  Temporal Workflow. This is useful if you want to build in a "low code" layer.

- [**Expense Request**](./expense): This demonstrates how to process
  an expense request. This sample showcases how to complete an Activity Execution asynchronously.

- [**File Processing**](./fileprocessing): Demonstrates how to
  download and process a file using set of Activities that run on the same host. Activities are executed to download a
  file from the web, store it locally on the host, and then "process it". This samples showcases how to handle a
  scenario where all subsequent Activities need to execute on the same host as the first Activity in the sequence. In
  Go, this is achieved by using the Session APIs.

- [**Particle Swarm Optimization**](./pso): Demonstrates how to
  perform a long iterative math optimization process using particle swarm optimization (PSO). This sample showcases the
  use of parallel executions, `ContinueAsNew` for long histories, a Query API, and the use of a custom `DataConverter`
  for serialization.

- [**Polling Services**](./polling): Recommended implementation of an activity that needs to periodically poll an external 
resource waiting its successful completion

- [**Prometheus Metrics**](./metrics): Demonstrates how to instrument
  Temporal with Prometheus and Uber's Tally library.

- [**Request/Response with Response Activities**](./reqrespactivity):
  Demonstrates how to accept requests via signals and use callback activities to push responses.

- [**Request/Response with Response Queries**](./reqrespquery):
  Demonstrates how to accept requests via signals and use queries to poll for responses.

- [**Request/Response with Response Updates**](./reqrespupdate):
  Demonstrates how to accept requests and responsond via updates.
