# Running these samples in a DevContainer

If you are reading this, then you probably have this repo open in a DevContainer: - [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers). 

## Start a local Temporal Server
This will run latest Temporal images in a docker network.

```bash
make start-local
```

You should now be able to run any of the samples locally in your dev container.
