## Synchronous Proxy Sample

This sample demonstrates how to achieve synchronous interaction with a main workflow.

We call this pattern a proxy workflow. The proxy workflow sends a signal to the main workflow and then blocks waiting for a signal in response.

This mimics a synchronous SendAndReceiveSignal feature which Temporal does not currently provide natively.

The flow of calls is outlined in the diagram below.

### Steps to run this sample:

1) Run a [Temporal service](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/main/#how-to-use).
2) Run the following command to start the worker
```shell
go run worker/main.go
```
3) Run the following command to start the simple UI
```shell
go run ui/main.go
```

Once the UI has exited you will be able to see delivery details in the worker output, as might have been emailed to you in a real implementation.
