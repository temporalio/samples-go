# Welcome to the Go SDK Gitpod setup!

If you're reading this, you probably clicked on our Gitpod link:
[![Gitpod ready-to-code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-ready--to--code-908a85?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/)

We have preconfigured Gitpod with some recommended settings (in [.gitpod.yml](/.gitpod.yml)).
When you first launch, we will open 3 terminals:

- Pane 1: Temporal Server - running in background with Docker Compose
- Pane 2: Hello World sample
  - Left: Temporal Worker - run `go run worker/main.go`
  - Right: Temporal Client - run `go run starter/main.go`

It takes ~1 minute for the Docker Compose cluster to start up, so we put in manual sleeps as we have not found a more reliable solution.

Once you have it up and running (Temporal Web should show the first Workflow Execution), you can use our [Hello World Walkthrough tutorial](https://learn.temporal.io/getting_started/go/hello_world_in_go) to orient you to the sample file structure.
